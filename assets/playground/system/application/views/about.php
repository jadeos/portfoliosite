                This site has been designed by four 3rd year Web Development Students. We were given a brief of designing a web application that
                will allow a user to search for a playground either by location or facilities. The user should be able to register with the site
                and leave reviews about the playgrounds that they have visited. They should also be able to request to add a playground by contacting
                admin by using the contact form. An administrator has the facility to log into the site and add, update or delete a playground.
